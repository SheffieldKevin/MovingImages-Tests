# MovingImages-Tests
Tests for the moving images framework

### MovingImages Framework public Interface tests

These tests are provided in their own public repository intended to be included as a git submodule in the private MovingImages Framework repository and in public repositories with projects that link against the MovingImages Framework.

These tests are far from complete. The coverage of the public API of the MovingImages framework for the video related functionality is reasonably complete.

Within the private MovingImages Framework repository there are a much larger number of tests written in that cover all the functionality of the framework.
